%timeit square_loop(numbers)
%timeit numbers**2 # NumPy vectorized

#Q10. Reflection
#Question: Why is it useful to mix Markdown and code in Jupyter notebooks?
#Answer:
#Mixing Markdown and code allows you to explain your thought process and document results directly alongside the code. 
#his improves the way you read, make your analysis, much more easier to follow, and it helps others understand your workflow without 
#needing to read just the code alone. It also supports professional reports and reproducible research.

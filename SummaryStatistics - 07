#Summary Statistics 

#Question: Which is more robust to outliers, the mean or the median?
#The median is more robust to outliers. A single extreme value 
# (like 100) can drastically pull the mean, but the median barely changes.

#Exercise: Add an extreme outlier (e.g., 100) to the dataset and 
#see how the mean, median, and standard deviation change.

data_outlier = data + [100]

print("Mean:",np.mean(data_outlier))
print("Median:",np.median(data_outlier))
print("Standard Deviation:",np.std(data_outlier, ddof=1))

#Task: Use .describe() on another dataset (e.g., penguins from Seaborn or your own CSV).

import seaborn as sns

penguins = sns.load_dataset("penguins")
penguins.describe()

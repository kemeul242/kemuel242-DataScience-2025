#Kemuel Hepburn
#Types of Data

#Here is the corrected table:

#Variable	        Qual/Quant	    Disc/Cont	Scale

#Country of Birth:	Qualitative	    –        	Nominal
#Shoe Size:	        Quantitative	Discrete*	Interval 
#Time to Run 5k:	Quantitative	Continuous	Ratio
##Temperature (°C):	Quantitative	Continuous	Interval
#Number of Pets:	Quantitative	Discrete	Ratio

#Shoe size is discrete (fixed increments) and technically interval because the zero point is #arbitrary, not “absence of a foot.”
#It is NOT ordinal — sizes have equal spacing.

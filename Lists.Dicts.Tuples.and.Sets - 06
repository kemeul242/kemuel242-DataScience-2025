#Lists, Dicts, Tuples, and Sets (Oh My!)

#Create a list of your top 5 favorite foods. Print the last item using a negative index.
#Create a dictionary that maps student names to GPA (be kind). Add a new student.
#Make a tuple of the days of the week. Try to change one. Document what happens.
#Create a set of course names. Add a duplicate. Reflect on how sets feel about duplicates.

# Lists
favorite_foods = ["pizza", "sushi", "tacos", "ice cream", "burger"]
print("Last favorite food:", favorite_foods[-1])

# Tuples
days_of_week = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
print("Days of the week tuple:", days_of_week)

# Attempting to modify a tuple (uncomment to see the error)
# days_of_week[0] = "Funday"
# This raises TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# Dictionaries
student_gpa = {
    "Bright": 3.9,
    "Lonzo": 3.5,
    "Magic": 3.7
}

# Add a new student
student_gpa["Wizzo"] = 4.0
print("Updated student GPAs:", student_gpa)

# Sets
course_names = {"CS101", "CS102", "CS103", "CS101"}  # Duplicate ignored
print("Courses after initial set:", course_names)

# Add a duplicate and a new course
course_names.add("CS102")  # No effect
course_names.add("CS104")
print("Courses after modifications:", course_names)

# Bonus: List comprehension for squares 1–20
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 21)]
print("Squares 1–20:", squares)

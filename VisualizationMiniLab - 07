#Visualization Mini-Lab: Trends and Outliers

#Tasks:Do some species have higher average body mass than others? Yes.
#Gentoo penguins have the highest average body mass, 
#followed by Adelie, and Chinstrap is the lightest.

#Which species tends to have longer flippers AND higher body mass?
#Gentoo penguins tend to have both longer flippers and higher body mass.

#Can you spot any outliers in the bill length data?
#Yes — Adelie and Chinstrap show a few outlier points 

#Which variables appear to be strongly correlated?
#1. Flipper length and body mass
#2. Bill length and bill depth also show moderate correlation

#Try it Yourself
#Try a different dataset (e.g., tips, iris).

tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
tips.head()

#Create at least 2 plots that reveal a trend.

tips["tip_pct"] = tips["tip"] / tips["total_bill"] * 100

sns.boxplot(data=tips, x="day", y="tip_pct")
plt.title("Tip Percentage by Day")
plt.show()

#Create 1 plot that highlights possible outliers.

sns.boxplot(data=tips, x="size", y="total_bill")
plt.title("Total Bill Outliers by Party Size")
plt.show()

#Write a short summary of your findings.
#In my findings of this notebook, i have concluded that:

#Penguins Dataset:
#Gentoo penguins are the largest: highest mass + longest flippers.
#Outliers appear in bill length, especially for Adelie and Chinstrap.
#Strong correlation between flipper length ↔ body mass.

#Tips Dataset:
#Tip amount increases with total bill (clear trend).
#Tip percentages vary by day; weekends slightly higher.
#Large party sizes show extreme outlier bills.

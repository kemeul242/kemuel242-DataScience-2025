#Write the quadratic formula in LaTeX.
The quadratic formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
The discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac$.

#Create a list of 3 numbers, calculate their cubes in code, then explain in Markdown.
numbers = [2, 3, 4]
cubes = [n**3 for n in numbers]
cubes
#The list `numbers` contains 2, 3, and 4.  
#The list `cubes` contains each number raised to the third power: 8, 27, and 64.  
#This demonstrates how combining Python calculations with Markdown explanations makes notebooks readable and professional.
